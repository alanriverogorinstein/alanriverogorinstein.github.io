<title>My work for Ancestry</title>

<h1>Ancestry</h1>

<blockquote>It is my pleasure and immense luck to contribute to the work of a brilliant institution that brings much joy and a feeling of profound belonging to million of people every day: Ancestry. In my role as a designer of their mobile app I think deeply about how to make the experience of going on a journey of personal discovery beautiful, easier, and more rewarding.</blockquote>

<b><i>Why even bother</i></b>
<p>One of the most useful ways to represent an ancestor on your family tree is using a little illustration. It's useful to have an avatar in there, and one of my colleagues, Anna, drew a collection of beautiful avatars that can be customized. My intention to further this idea and defend it so that it gets built, I wrote an app that lets users feel what it would feel like to use Anna's beautiful custom avatars by making a custom avatar.</p>
