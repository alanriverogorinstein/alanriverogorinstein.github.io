  <p>We'll do a million things in the short something we have in between the bookends of nothing: we'll do the laundry, check the time, turn on the dishwasher...we'll do genealogy online and log on to the internet to manage any number of things...we might as well carry them through surrounded by the most beautiful, surprising, and delightful design choices around us. Might as well wonder; might as well notice the small things that brighten our day.</p>
